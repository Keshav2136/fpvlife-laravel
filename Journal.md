[18 March Mid Night.]

Opened PHPMyAdmin to create DB how I wanted and created tables. Used ChatGPT to make the tables.

Installed Composer globally.

Used it to install latest Laravel.

Tried to migrate but couldn't. Error: Said it "users" table was already made.

Fixed that by exporting the DB and deleting all the tables.

    LEARNINGS:
    PHP Eloquent or Query Builder is used to build tables and make changes in the DB.
